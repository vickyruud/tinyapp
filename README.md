## Using TinyApp

### Register/Login
You must login to create, view, edit or delete links.
If you have not created an account yet, please click on Register to create a new account. On the registration page, enter your email address and create a password. You will then be automatically logged into the website.

### Create new links
Click on the Create New URL link on the top of the page. You will then have to enter the complete url that you would like to shorten. This will create a short URL and store it under the My URLs page.

### Editing or Deleting URLs
You can edit or delete existing links from the My URLs page. Simply click on the delete button next to the the desired URL and it will be deleted.

Clicking on the edit button will take you to the edit page where you can enter a new long URL to relpace the existing one. The same short URL link will now redirect you to the new long URL.

### Using the Short URL

The path to use any short link is localhost:8080/u/:shortURL. This will take you directly to the long URL associated with the particular short URL.

### Logout
Once you are done, click on the Logout button to logout.
